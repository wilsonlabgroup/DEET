\usage{
DEET_data_download(x = "ALL")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{categorical variable containing options "ALL", "enrich",
"metadata" or "feature_matrix".}
}
\value{
Named list with the neccesary data required to input into
DEET_feature_extract or DEET_enrich. The metadata within DEET
can also be downloaded.

\itemize{
\item feature_matrix - A gene by comparison matrix populated
with the log2FC of gene expression for the genes that are
considered DE within the study (padj < 0.05).
\item metadata - a comparison - by - explanatory piece of data dataframe
providing important details to contextualize each study.
For every pairwise comparison, the study name,
source (SRA, TCGA, GTEx and SRA-manual),
description from the DRA compendium,
the number of samples (total, up-condition,
and down-condition), samples (total ,up-condition, down-condition),
tissue (including tumour from TCGA),
number of DEs (total, up-condition, down-condition),
age (mean +- sd), sex, top 15 DEGs - up, top 15 DEGs - down,
top 5 enriched pathways, and top 5 enriched TFs.
PMID are also available for studies selected from SRA.
Lastly, each pairwise comparison was given an overall
category based on those decided in Crow et al., 2019.
\item DEET_enrich - A named list of seven objects containing
the data frames summarizing the DEGs from comparisons within
DEET, GMT objects of comparisons within DEET for enrichment
through ActivePathways, GMT objects for basic pathway and TF
enrichment, and a dataframe for the metadata of each study.
For more detail on each element of the list, please consult
the vignette or "?DEET_example_data", as it is a subset
of this object
